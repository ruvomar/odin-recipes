                <li><h2>Directions</h2></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with 
                        salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to 
                        medium-low and simmer until slightly soft, 5 
                        to 6 minutes. Drain.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cook chorizo in a large skillet over medium-high 
                        heat, breaking up any large clumps, until browned, 
                        5 to 6 minutes. Remove chorizo to a paper towel-lined 
                        plate using a slotted spoon, reserving about 1 
                        tablespoon grease in the skillet. Add oil if necessary 
                        to make up 1 tablespoon.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cook onion in the same skillet over medium heat, 
                        stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften 
                        and brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add potatoes to the skillet 
                        and saut√© until potatoes are lightly browned, 5 to 7 
                        minutes. Stir in chorizo and season with salt and pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
