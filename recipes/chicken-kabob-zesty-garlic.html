                <li><h2>Directions</h2></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Making the spice blend:</strong> In a small bowl, 
                        add 2 teaspoons paprika, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 
                        1 teaspoon ground nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon ground green cardamom. 
                        Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix to combine.</li>

                    <li><strong>Prepping the chicken:</strong> Cut 2 pounds of boneless, 
                        skinless chicken breasts into 1 ½-inch cubes. Set in a large 
                        bowl and pour the spice mix on top. Use your hands to 
                        generously coat the chicken with the spices.</li>

                    <li><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> In a small bowl, 
                        whisk together 15 minced garlic cloves and the juice of 3 lemons 
                        (or 6 limes). Add 1 sliced yellow onion to the bowl with the 
                        chicken, then pour the lemon juice mixture over top. Add a 
                        generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Toss the chicken 
                        to ensure it's well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 4 
                        hours for the best results. <em>This is a great time to get 
                        your fixings ready and your bamboo skewers soaking.</em></li>

                    <li><strong>Skewer:</strong> Slice a red onion, red bell pepper, 
                        and green bell pepper into 1 ½-inch pieces. A few minutes before 
                        grilling, thread the chicken, bell peppers, and red onion 
                        onto the skewers (discard the yellow onion, it was just to 
                        flavor the chicken). Lightly oil and heat a gas grill or griddle 
                        to medium-high heat.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Grill:</strong> Grill the chicken kabobs, turning 
                        occasionally until chicken is cooked through (internal 
                        temperature should register 165°F), 10-12 minutes. 
                        <strong>Now serve and enjoy this fabulous dish!</strong></li>
